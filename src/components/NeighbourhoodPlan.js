    <h2>Neighbourhood Plan</h2>
    <p>
      We need to make sure the Neighbourhood Plan (link) being developed for Ilkley contains commitments to tackling  the challenge of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan carries some weight legally once it has been passed by referendum in Ilkley next year. This means itâ€™s very important to use it to specify things like improving cycling routes, improving pedestrian experiences and also building standards relating to tackling climate change.
